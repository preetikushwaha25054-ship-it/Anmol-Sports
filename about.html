            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Anmol Sports was founded in **20/08/2023** with a simple goal: to provide high-quality, reliable sports
                equipment to athletes of all levels. What started as a small local shop selling basic gear has grown
                into a trusted national supplier, driven by our passion for sports and commitment to performance. We
                believe that the right equipment can make all the difference, helping you push boundaries and achieve
                greatness.</p>
            <p>**Our Roots:** With over 3, 4 years of experience, we opened our first shop in Aadarsha Nagar, Kawardha.
                Since then, we have been supporting not just the gear, but also the dreams of players. We consider our
                customers family and are committed to providing the best sporting experience.</p>
